	description="x3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM mainframe\
	host in an X11 window.  It can also connect to an IBM AS/400 as a\
	5250 terminal using the AS/400's 3270 emulation.  The window created\
	by x3270 can use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a\
	fairly accurate representation of an IBM 3278 or 3279."
